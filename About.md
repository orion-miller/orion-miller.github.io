I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently working as a Tire Engineer in NASCAR. My work focuses on lab tire testing, NASCAR track testing, DiL Simulation with NASCAR drivers, Data Analysis, Mathematical Modeling, and Software Development. 

Previously I attended the University of Guelph for Mechanical Engineering where I was part of the Gryphon Racing Formula SAE Team for 3 years. As the Suspension Lead I drove the design, manufacturing, and testing of the car's suspension system, according to vehicle performance goals.
