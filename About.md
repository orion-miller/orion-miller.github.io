I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently working in motorsports. My main focuses are tire engineering, vehicle data processing, and vehicle simulation, working within NASCAR and Sportscar programs. My work has included experience with lab tire testing, track testing, DiL simulation, mathematical modeling, and software development. 

Previously I attended the University of Guelph for Mechanical Engineering where I was part of the Gryphon Racing Formula SAE Team for 3 years. As the Suspension Lead I drove the design, manufacturing, and testing of the car's suspension system.

This is a space to share some of my projects and thoughts.
