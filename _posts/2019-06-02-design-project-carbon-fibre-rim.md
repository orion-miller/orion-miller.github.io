This was a year-long Senior Capstone Design Project. The group developed a lightweight carbon fiber rim design for Formula SAE. The goal of the project was to produce a functional prototype and lay the groundwork for a transition to carbon wheels for future Gryhon Racing entries.   

My responsibilities included:  
• Determination of suitable wheel loading cases from vehicle telemetry and tire test data   
• FEA analysis of OEM aluminum wheels to set strength and stiffness benchmarks for the new design  
• Design of the carbon wheel profile and mold assembly  
• Manufacturing of the mold assembly using manual and CNC mills
