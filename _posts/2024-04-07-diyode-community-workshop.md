For the past year I've been a part of [Diyode](https://diyode.com/blog/) in Guelph, a community workshop for woodworking, metalworking, electronics and more. This is an all-volunteer environment that empowers people to build their personal projects with support from other makers. 

At Diyode I did some hands-on projects and helped to improve and maintain the shop space.
