This was a past group project. The course requirements were open ended; any design related to any engineering discipline could be pursued, with emphasis placed on developing proper project management and documentation skills. The group decided to partner with a faculty professor on the development of a preliminary heat exchanger design for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell vehicles. My focus included heat transfer and materials analysis, and CAD modeling of the final design.
