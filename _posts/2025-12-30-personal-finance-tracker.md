I recently built a personal finance tracker [here](https://github.com/orion-miller/Personal-Finance-Tracker) as a way of learning to make desktop applications using the PySide6 Qt binding.

Having previously developed software tools using MATLAB App Designer, had been looking for a framework with similar features in Python, out of desire to shift to a more mainstream approach, with Python's benefits of a large open-source ecosystem and avoiding need for paid licenses or toolboxes.
