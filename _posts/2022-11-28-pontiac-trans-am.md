I bought this car in July 2021 in Atlanta. These Trans Ams were always my favorite cars growing up, when one just like this was in my neighbourhood. This car had been sitting for a long time but was very clean and completely stock. Wanting to keep the car original no real modifications have been made, mostly just maintenance work and a few quality of life improvements.
