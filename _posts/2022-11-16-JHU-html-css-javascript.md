This was an online course offered by Johns Hopkins University teaching the fundamentals of web development. It covered to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to set up the structure, formatting, and interactivity of a website, and how to make website flexible and user friendly across a wide range of devices. 

I was interested in this course because I wanted to get some formal instruction in web design, to help me better use HTML and CSS for Python Dashboards for data visualization. I also applied some of the course concepts building this website.
