# The Importance of Tire Load Dependence

A well known phenomenon of Tire Dynamics is the coefficient of friction's dependence on normal force. As normal force increases, the coefficient of friction not only decreases, but decreases in a non-linear manner. This one fact leads to a staggering amount of important ripple effects.  

## Load Dependence Physics
Friction is not just a property of the tire. To determine friction you need to udnerstand the tire-road interface.

The effective area of contact will be dependent on the normal load, the hardness of the rubber, and the road surface profile. A common simplied model for conceptualizing the road surface is x (Persson Klupel lecture 3 slide). With this model we can intuitively see how the effective contact area will not increase proportionately to the load. This would carry through into the amount of available grip, hence the reason why there is a relationship of diminishing returns.

Load dependence can vary depending on the road surface, and even the tire state! As the compound hardness is sensitive to factors such as temperature, frequency.

Normal load has to be broken down into an X-Y distribution of contact pressure.

## Load Dependence Implications
Different ways load dependence can manifest itself:

### Surface Roughness
Higher surface roughness will equate to more contact pressure variation.

### Camber Effects

### Load Transfer


### Suspension Movement
Rapid oscillation in load will mean less grip. This establishes the suspension design goal of minimizing load variation to maximize available grip.

Relaxation length models generally work by spoofing a transient slip angle. Built into this setup is the assumption that slip angle is the main variable of interest in dictating the FY response. However FZ is highly influential also, and for rough tracks this will be a non-trivial effect.
